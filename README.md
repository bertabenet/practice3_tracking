This project contains a little test on how the PoseNetOSC works for unity. More specifically it tracks the following parts of the body each represented with a cube in a different color:
| Part of body | Cube's Color |
| :---: | :---:|
| Nose | Blue |
| Right Wrist | Red |
| Left Wrist | Green |
| Right Ankle | Purple |
| Left Ankle | Yellow |

The objective is to match each cube with the sphere of the same color all at once.
